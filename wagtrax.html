                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Wagtrax is a start up conceived of by the owner of the currently existing Breederzoo, a program that helps 
                        breeders manage their kennel and all associated records. After several conversations with clients of hers 
                        who were also board members of breeding clubs, she sought to create an equivalent software for those clubs 
                        with the possibility of merging the two in the future.<br><br>

                        Dog Breeding Clubs, such as the AKC, are non-profit organizations that set and enforce ethical breeding 
                        standards for certain breeds. Each club can have upwards of thousands of Breeder Members, who join primarily 
                        to 1) receive certification proving their quality to customers and 2) gain access to the club’s database of 
                        animals, breeders, pedigrees, and health testing. This information is vital in ensuring that the dams and studs
                        breeders pair make a genetically healthy match. In addition, clubs also have Pet Members, who join with the 
                        goal of finding breeders and puppies adhere to a standard they agree with.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="standarddiv" class="problem">
                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>Dog breeding clubs currently lack an affordable and efficient way to manage and display their members’ registered
                        dogs and associated records, so that breeder members can effectively research each stud and dam within their 
                        database for genetic compatibility.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="standarddiv" class="goals">
                    <h2>Our goals</h2>
                    <p>Our primary goal was to at minimum, cut the amount of time required to register and research dogs in the club 
                        databases by half. Currently existing solutions require breeders and board members to spend several hours, 
                        if not days, on these work flows.  We decided to focus first on the search function, as it was ultimately at
                        the core of both of these experiences. Specifically, we sought to cut the time needed for Breeder Members to
                        research a stud by at least 50%.</p>

                <div class="standarddiv" class="myrole">
                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>I was brought on as the lead UX/UI designer. My responsibilities included, gathering requirements, user research, 
                        competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, user testing, branding, as well as presenting all of these 
                        findings to the development team in meetings that I facilitated.<br><br>

                        My design process for this project is outlined below:</p>
                    <img src="images/Process_Chart.svg">
                </div>

        <section class="step1">
            <div class="content">
                <h1>Step 1: Discovery</h1>
                <div class="standarddiv" class="requirements">
                    <h2>Gathering Requirements</h2>
                    <p>One of the primary reasons I was brought onto the team was to clear up confusion and miscommunication between the
                        Dev Team and Product Owner/Stakeholders. This needed addressed first before the usual design process could begin.
                        While the developers had done amazing work creating an algorithm for calculating inbreeding coefficients, they
                        were unsure of the full scope of the project or what needs it was addressing that weren’t already met by BreederZoo.

                        As Christy had mentioned the desire to merge BreederZoo with Wagtrax in the future, I set out to get a better idea
                        of the full scope of the project, specifically to identify the Minimum Viable Product and the potential future scope
                        of the product as well. The Project Manager and I facilitated meetings with the Product Owner and Stakeholders (all
                        board members) to better understand clubs’ needs, breeders’ needs, and where they overlap. We had much success during
                            a whiteboard meeting which mapped out these differences. While the dev team was expected to first focus on creating 
                            the Minimum Viable Product, the overlap gave us significantly more clarity in regards to the potential future scope
                            of the product so we could build accordingly. This results of this meeting are outlined in the venn diagram below.</p>

                <div class="standarddiv" class="interviews">
                    <h2>User Interviews</h2>
                    <p>Once we had a better grasp on the scope of the project and requirements, I conducted interviews with 5 different users 
                        at roughly 45 minutes each to learn more specifics about the inner workings of breeding clubs, relationships between 
                        different types of users, and goals/motivations each user has when working with the club. Though our pool was limited 
                        due to being unable to attend conferences or use guerilla methods, amongst the interviewees we secured were veteran 
                        breeders who had decades’ worth of insight on the breeding process, currently existing software, and breeders themselves. 

                        From these interviews I was able to glean at a high level three different types of users we would see using our product: 
                        Club Board Members, Breeder Members, and Pet Members. I also learned about their roles within the club,  
                        the motivations/expectations they had when signing up with a breeding club, and what factored into their decision when 
                        choosing a club to join.
                        
                        While the majority of this information is outlined in the “Synthesize” step later on, below is a diagram used to 
                        communicate at a high level our three different users, their goals within the club, and their relationships to one 
                        another.</p>

                <div class="standarddiv" class="contextualinquiry">
                    <h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
                    <p>Following the user interviews, I conducted a second round of remote meetings with the same 5 individuals at roughly 45 
                        minutes each. This time was spent having breeders walk me through their work flow when seeking a stud to breed with one 
                        of their dams. Throughout this process, I noted significant issues in the methods and user interfaces clubs use that could 
                        tack hours, sometimes even days onto their members’ research. Issues included confusing user interfaces, search engine bugs 
                        that rendered the feature unusable, and missing dog information that would require the user to contact breeder members through 
                        email.</p>

                    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                    <p>To further understand why users find current solutions unsatisfactory, I selected two top competitors, as well as an anonymous 
                        club that was using a custom built UI. I compared and contrasted the services offered by each of these solutions to identify 
                        niches in the market. Next, since poor usability was one of the top pain points found in previous stages, I ran a heuristic 
                        evaluation on the top three competitors to pin point more specifically where these usability issues were. Multiple significant 
                        failures were found regarding most of the 10 heuristics, most notably: visibility of system status, error prevention, recognition 
                        over recall, flexibility and efficiency of use, aesthetic and minimalist design, error recovery, and help and documentation.</p>

                        Architecture was in line with user expectations.  I gathered users again for short 15 minute sessions in which they were given an 
                        assortment of virtual cards through Figma, each representing the content that would be handled by wagtrax (EG: Register a litter, 
                        Studs, Dams, puppies, Breeder Members). After grouping the content, they were asked to label each category. These results were later 
                        utilized when creating the site map.</p>

                    <p>I began the Synthesis phase by creating personas to help the team better empathize with our users and their motivations using our 
                        software, which seved to be the catalyst for a notable boost in team morale and productivity. The personas I created were representative

                        with our search feature was on the breeder member, as they most heavily rely on this club feature when researching their breeding pairs and 
                        share similar motivations and pain points with the Board Members and Pet Members. </p>

                    <h2>Site Mapping</h2>
                    <p>Keeping the above improvements to flow in mind, I went ahead and created a comprehensive site map from the perspective of the 
                        Board Member (our direct customer). The reason I chose this perspective was because their flows were the most extensive and 
                        could be easily extrapolated into Breeder Member and Pet Member site maps by simply shaving away the unneeded features. Also 
                        included were the flows for potential future expansion of the site. </p>

                    <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                    <p>While iterating, one of the biggest decisions I grappled with was whether to utilize top or sidebar navigation. Sidebar eventually 
                        won out for several reasons: it was the more prominent and visible solution to orient the user, it would allow for easy vertical 
                        expansion when adding more features to the club in the future, and all users reported the most intimate familiarity with Facebook 
                        and Gmail: both of which utilize sidebar nav. A less prominent top navigation was included as well for secondary features such as 
                        account management, search, and orientation to the club name.</p>

                    <p>Of this entire project, I made the most mistakes, primarily regarding efficiency, and also learned the most during this stage - 
                        which I will expand on in the “reflections” section later. However, efficiency aside, I was able to get a working prototype going 
                        that laid a solid foundation for the final design. Though the design changed significantly between this stage and the final product, 
                        I was able to glean a plethora of valuable input from the team and users when utilizing this prototype for usability testing.</p>

                    <p>Before moving onto usability testing, I wanted to discover and knock out as many design flaws in the prototype as possible before 
                        taking up users’ time. So I ran a heuretic evaluation on my new design as I did earlier our competitors’. Though the prototype wasn’t 
                        quite interactive enough to catch everything, I was able to catch a few issues at this point that were corrected before presenting to 
                        the users.</p>

                        three who were new to breeding.  All participants were given the task to find a stud through the Wagtrax UI that they would like to 
                        breed their current dam with. The task was considered over when participants were able to locate contact information for the stud’s 
                        breeder. All participants gave valuable feedback regarding the flow, features they wished to see, and overall aesthetic. These 
                        comments were noted and taken into account during the final design.</p>

                    <h2>Reflections</h2>
                    <p>Wagtrax was the first major project I took on in my career and as a result, I learned a lot of valuable lessons with the attitude of 
                        “failing forward”. Knowing what I do now, here are a few things I would’ve done differently.<br><br>

                        <strong>Wireframe collaboratively:</strong> One of the biggest challenges of this project was getting everyone I needed together in one place at 
                        the same time, due to schedule conflicts and time zones. Breeders are busy individuals! Sprints definitely suffered in regards to 
                        efficiency, as I took the approach of designing individually and then meeting with the team, product owners, etc. and presenting for 
                        feedback, which I would take note of and then repeat the process. If I could go back to one of those rare occasions we were all 
                        together, I would have worked in a remote whiteboard meeting where we could all collaborate</p>
